Hello Everyone! I'm Aarav.

I am a rising highschool student. I’m passionate about space, technology, and building things that work. I’ve designed a satellite, built a high-end telescope, done independent research on interplanetary living, and worked on projects involving 3D printing, coding, and AI. I enjoy turning ideas into real projects and exploring new challenges.
